# Movie Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a movie dataset to uncover insights about movie ratings, genres, and financial performance. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive meaningful conclusions about trends in the movie industry.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for interactive computing.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is named `movie.csv`. It contains various features related to movies, including:

- **title**: Title of the movie
- **genres**: List of genres associated with the movie
- **duration**: Length of the movie in minutes
- **budget**: Production budget of the movie
- **gross**: Gross revenue generated by the movie
- **imdb_score**: IMDB rating of the movie
- **director_name**: Director of the movie
- **country**: Country of production

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves:

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Removed rows with less than 4% missing values.
   - Imputed missing values for columns with more than 5% missing values using appropriate methods (mode for categorical, median for numerical).

2. **Dealing with Outliers**:
   - Identified and removed outliers in the `duration` column using the IQR method.

3. **Data Type Adjustments**:
   - Converted columns to appropriate data types (e.g., integers for review counts, datetime for `title_year`).

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created a `primary_genre` column to identify the most relevant genre for each movie.
   - Added a `Net revenue` column to analyze financial performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA process includes:

- Analyzing the average ratings of movies over the years.
- Exploring the average rating by genre.
- Investigating the total revenue generated by each director.
- Identifying the top 10 countries in movie production.

## Future Work

- Explore additional features such as the number of genres per movie and its effect on ratings.
- Conduct sentiment analysis on reviews to correlate sentiments with movie ratings.
- Build predictive models to estimate ratings based on features like budget and genre.
